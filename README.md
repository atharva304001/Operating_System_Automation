What is operating system?
    An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.
    Some popular Operating Systems include Linux Operating System, Windows Operating System, VMS, Mac operating system, OS/400, etc. 
In Mac Os we have command line, In windows we have command prompt, In Linux we have terminal.

How we are going to automate operating system?
    Operating System Automation is a software that helps both, students and teachers. For example: Our Operating system automation is capable of automating the task of opening apps like chrome, google meet, zoom, WhatsApp, PowerPoint, notepad etc.
    Suppose some user has some defined tasks like opening chrome, then opening Gmail, then WhatsApp, google meet,  all these tasks will get automated with the help of this program.  User can directly start working on the applications. Which will save the time of user.
To automate the operating system we have used libraries of JavaScript. JavaScript has library NodeJs and in NodeJS there is robot.Js module which we used for automating mouse, keyboard, screen, etc.
