# Operating System Automation

Automated system operations (ASO) are the set of software and hardware that allows 
computer systems, network devices or machines to function without any manual intervention.
Operating System Automation is a software that helps both the students and teachers. For 
example: Our Operating system automation is capable of automating the task of opening apps 
like chrome, Google meet, zoom, WhatsApp, PowerPoint, Notepad etc.
To automate the operating system, we have used library of JavaScript. JavaScript has library 
Nodejs and in Nodejs there is Robot.js module which we used for automating mouse, keyboard, 
screen, etc.
When we switch on our system, we as students or teachers perform a set of tasks on a regular 
basis and these monotonous tasks have become a part of our daily lives. To make these 
operational and repetitive tasks less burdensome we automated the operating system in a way 
that when you turn your system on, these processes will be carried out automatically by the 
designed algorithm.
 To achieve our goal, we made use of libraries of Javascript. We designed and 
composed a certain set of tasks that the program will carry out once the system is turned on 
automatically. This will make our work efficient and effortless. The defined flow of action will be 
executed without any manual intervention

What is operating system?
 An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and 
computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the 
basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, 
handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives 
and printers.
 Some popular Operating Systems include Linux Operating System, Windows 
Operating System, VMS, Mac operating system, OS/400, etc. 
In Mac Os we have command line, in windows we have command prompt, In 
Linux we have terminal.

How we are going to automate operating system?


 Operating System Automation is a software that helps both the students and 
teachers. For example: Our Operating system automation is capable of 
automating the task of opening apps like chrome, google meet, zoom, WhatsApp, 
PowerPoint, notepad etc.
 Suppose some user has some defined tasks like opening chrome, then opening 
Gmail, then WhatsApp, google meet and all these tasks will get automated with 
the help of this software. Because of this software user can directly start working 
on the applications. This will save the time of user and reduce the efforts of user.
To automate the operating system, we have used libraries of JavaScript. 
JavaScript has library NodeJs and in NodeJS there is RobotJS module which we 
used for automating mouse, keyboard, screen, etc.
